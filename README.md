# FSimZoo
[FSimZoo.jl](https://github.com/JinraeKim/FSimZoo.jl)
contains predefined environments and controllers for [FlightSims.jl](https://github.com/JinraeKim/FlightSims.jl).

## Road map
- [ ] Re-write missile environments and guidance laws; import them from [FlightGNC.jl](https://github.com/nhcho91/FlightGNC.jl).
- [ ] Re-name environments and controllers. Current naming is too confusing and unorganised.
